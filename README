BOIDS package for Cycling 74's Max with support for Jitter Matricies

Boids is a bird flight and animal flock simulator. It is based on the same 
algorithm which was used in Jurassic Park for the herding dinosaurs.

Boids takes an integer argument which is the number of boids.
Each time Boids receives a bang, it calculates and outputs the new positions of the boids.
The output consists of thew coordiantes for each boid, the number and type depending on the mode.

The flight parameters can be changed with messages.
Use the 'dump' message to output a list of the current parameter settings. 

For more information about the Boids algorithm, see Craig Reynolds' Web site at "http://reality.sgi.com/employees/craig/boids.html".
